# Snacks/Components

Enough for a small meal or to hold you over until the next one.
Components are part of a larger meal

## Instant Oatmeal

5 minutes  
This is just here to remind you it exists (and is reasonably healthy, unlike instant ramen).

### Equipment

* Personal bowl
* Personal spoon
* Method to heat water

### Ingredients

* Hot water
* Instant oatmeal

### Steps

1. Add instant oatmeal to bowl.
2. Add around 1 cup hot water to bowl.
3. Stir well; let sit for 1 minute.

## Scrambled Eggs

15 minutes

### Equipment

* Stove
* Pan, preferably non-stick
* Rubber spatula
* Side bowl
* Fork

### Ingredients

* 1-3 eggs
* Salt
* Pepper, other seasoning of preference
* Water
* 1 tbsp butter

### Steps

1. Crack the eggs into a side bowl. Whisk slightly with fork.
2. Add "a little" water to the side bowl (around 1 tsp per egg, not exact).
3. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the bowl. This can be varied by preference.
4. Continue to whisk the mixture until relatively uniform.
5. With the stove on 6-7, melt and cover the pan with 1 tbsp of butter.
this step can be performed concurrently somewhere around steps 1-4, but care
must be taken not to let the butter burn.
6. Pour the scrambled egg mixture into the pan and cook:
	* Regularly mix with the spatula. Do not let any part touch the pan for too long.
	* It may help to chop up large cooked masses if there are > 2 eggs.
	* A low, slow cook is better than fast and hot.
	* Remove from heat once no liquid egg remains or before burning occurs. This varies by preference
7. Serve on to plate with desired sides or additional seasonings.

### Notes

* When cooking, do not be afraid to turn the heat down to 5-6. The eggs will benefit most likely.
* The cleanup is significantly easier if performed as soon as possible (before consumption).

# Large Meals

These produce portions large enough to satisfy you for a meal. Some can be made in bulk
and eaten over a week.

## McCormick's Chilli

60-120 minutes; bulk-able  
This is literally the recipe on the back of the chilli packet, but it's delicious.
An excellent choice for meal-prepping. Simply double, triple, etc... the portions
as needed. Do not change the amount of olive oil.

### Equipment

* Stove
* Large, deep pot
* Large mixing spoon
* (Optional) Meat mixer/breaker

### Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 1 lb lean ground beef
* 1 package McCormick Chilli Seasoning Mix
* 1 can diced tomatoes, **undrained**
* 1 can kidney beans, **undrained**

### Steps

1. Brown the beef:
	1. Lightly coat the bottom of the pot in olive oil
	(make a fast 5 point star).
	2. With the stove on 6-7, add the ground beef to the pot.
	3. Continuously mix and break the beef. Proceed once there are no
	red spots remaining.
2. Add all other ingredients: **undrained** tomatoes, **undrained** beans, and FINALLY chilli seasoning.
3. Continuously mix until the chilli begins simmering.
4. Lower the stove to 3-4 and allow the water to simmer off until desired consistence is reached (15-90 minutes).
5. Serve into bowls. Leave on heat while serving.

### Notes

* This recipe can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for longer. It is excellent
for meal prepping.
* Add water and mix if the leftovers are too dry.
* Serves well with sour cream, shredded cheese, and/or crushed tortilla chips.

## Buttered Noodles and Broccoli

25 minutes  
Simple, but good enough to eat regularly. You can add any vegetable you want,
but broccoli complements spaghetti particularly well. This meal is deficient
in protein if you eat it regularly.

### Equipment

* Stove
* Pot, 2 recommended
* Colander

### Ingredients

* Spaghetti
* Broccoli
* 1 tbsp Butter
* Salt

### Steps

1. Cook broccoli as described in [Boiled Vegetables](#boiled-vegetables).
2. Cook spaghetti as described in [Spaghetti](#spaghetti).
	* If you have 2 pots, this can be done in parallel.
3. Strain the broccoli first, then spaghetti. Mix well.
4. Serve into bowl, add salt and butter as desired.

## Egg Drop Ramen

10 minutes  
Ramen alone doesn't constitute a full meal, but eggs add quite a bit of heft!

### Equipment

* Pot
* Stove
* Mixing bowl

### Ingredients

* Ramen Noodles
* 2 eggs
* Any desired seasonings

### Steps

1. Cook the ramen in boiling water as directed on the package
(~2 minutes for instant ramen, more for regular ramen)...
2. Crack 2 eggs into a mixing bowl. **Do not scramble the eggs**!
3. With the water at a gentle boil, add the egg mixture raw and cook for 30 seconds.
	* Do not stir the eggs or they will disintegrate. It's gross.
4. Remove from heat and serve into a bowl.
